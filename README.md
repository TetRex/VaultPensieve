# VaultPensieve

An Obsidian plugin that integrates AI directly into your vault. Chat with Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or a local Ollama model in a sidebar, run writing commands on your notes, use inline fast answers, and let the AI read and modify your vault through tool calling.

---

## First start

### 1. Install the plugin

Copy these three files into your vault's plugin folder:

```
<your-vault>/.obsidian/plugins/vault-pensieve/
  main.js
  manifest.json
  styles.css
```

Then in Obsidian: **Settings → Community plugins → turn off Restricted mode → enable VaultPensieve**.

### 2. Choose a provider

Open **Settings → VaultPensieve** and choose your AI provider.

---

#### Option A — Anthropic (Claude)

Paste your Anthropic API key into the **API key** field.
Get a key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).

Click **Test** to verify the connection.

Two models are available:

| Model | Speed | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Fast | $3 / $15 per 1M tokens |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fastest | $1 / $5 per 1M tokens |

You can switch Anthropic models directly from the chat sidebar at any time.

---

#### Option B — OpenAI

Paste your OpenAI API key into the **API key** field.

Click **Test** to verify the connection.

The plugin currently exposes these OpenAI models:

| Model | Estimated cost used for tracking |
|---|---|
| GPT-5.4 | $2.50 / $15.00 per 1M input/output tokens |
| GPT-5.4 mini | $0.75 / $4.50 per 1M input/output tokens |
| GPT-5.4 nano | $0.20 / $1.25 per 1M input/output tokens |
| GPT-5 mini | $0.25 / $2.00 per 1M input/output tokens |

You can switch OpenAI models directly from the chat sidebar at any time.

---

#### Option C — OpenRouter

Paste your OpenRouter API key into the **API key** field.

Set **Model** to any OpenRouter model id, for example:

- `openrouter/auto`
- `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`

Click **Test** to verify the connection.

OpenRouter model selection is configured in settings rather than a predefined dropdown in the chat header.

---

#### Option D — Ollama (local, free)

Ollama runs AI models on your own machine. No API key or internet connection required.

1. [Download and install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) for your OS.
2. Launch Ollama and pull the recommended model: `ollama pull gemma4`
3. Click **Test** in settings to confirm Ollama is reachable and that the selected model advertises tool calling support.

The plugin expects Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`. The default model is `gemma4`. If the plugin can reach Ollama, installed models appear in a dropdown. If not, you can enter a model name manually. Tool calling requires a model that supports native tool or function calling.

---

### 3. Customize assistant behavior (optional)

Use **Custom system prompt** in **Settings → VaultPensieve** to add instructions that should apply to every request.

This is the primary place to define tone, formatting preferences, writing constraints, or vault-specific behavior.

### 4. Set a spending limit (optional)

In **Settings → VaultPensieve**, set a **Monthly spending limit** in dollars. Requests will be blocked once the limit is reached. The counter resets automatically on the first of each month.

Spend tracking is available for Anthropic models and the built-in tracked OpenAI models. It is not currently tracked for OpenRouter or Ollama.

## Features

### Chat sidebar

Open the chat panel from the ribbon icon or via **Command Palette → Open VaultPensieve**.

- **Model switcher** — change models without leaving the chat. Anthropic and OpenAI use built-in model lists. Ollama shows installed models when reachable
- **Attach note** — click the paperclip to attach the currently open note as context. The note name appears as a chip; click × to detach before sending
- **Chat history** — clock icon shows all saved conversations. Click any entry to resume it; × to delete
- **New chat** — plus icon starts a fresh conversation (current chat is saved automatically)
- **Prompt history** — press ↑/↓ in the input box to navigate previously sent messages
- **Usage bar** — shows current monthly spend vs your limit for providers/models with spend tracking. Turns red when the limit is reached
- **Token count** — each response shows the output token count at the bottom of the bubble
- **Settings shortcut** — gear icon opens the settings page directly

Messages support full Markdown rendering — headings, bold, code blocks, lists, and links all display correctly.

The AI uses vault tools silently in the background. A notice appears whenever a file is created or modified.

### Writing commands

Three writing commands are available via the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+P`):

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Continue writing** | Takes text before the cursor and streams a continuation |
| **Summarize note** | Summarizes the full content of the current note |
| **Improve / rewrite selection** | Rewrites the selected text while preserving its meaning |

All three commands open a **preview modal** before applying any changes:
- The original text is shown on top
- The suggestion streams in below in real time
- **Accept** — applies the change to the editor
- **Retry** — generates a new suggestion
- **Cancel** — discards and closes

### Fast answer

Type a line that starts with `::` inside a note, for example:

```md
:: what are the main themes of this note?
```

Press `Enter` and VaultPensieve replaces that line with a formatted inline Q/A block while the answer streams into the note.

### Vault tools (agentic loop)

When asked, the AI can interact with your vault directly:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_files` | Lists files in a folder |
| `read_note` | Reads the full content of a note |
| `create_note` | Creates a new note with given content |
| `update_note` | Replaces the content of an existing note |
| `search_notes` | Full-text search across all notes |
| `get_vault_structure` | Returns the folder tree |

## Privacy & security

- API keys are stored via Obsidian's plugin data (`data.json`) and are never logged by the plugin
- When using Ollama, note content stays on your machine unless your Ollama server is remote
- When using Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter, the request content needed for chat or commands is sent to the selected provider
